            <p>EEBO-TCP is a partnership between the Universities of Michigan and Oxford and the publisher ProQuest to create accurately transcribed and encoded texts based on the image sets published by ProQuest via their Early English Books Online (EEBO) database (http://eebo.chadwyck.com). The general aim of EEBO-TCP is to encode one copy (usually the first edition) of every monographic English-language title published between 1473 and 1700 available in EEBO.</p>
            <p>EEBO-TCP aimed to produce large quantities of textual data within the usual project restraints of time and funding, and therefore chose to create diplomatic transcriptions (as opposed to critical editions) with light-touch, mainly structural encoding based on the Text Encoding Initiative (http://www.tei-c.org).</p>
            <p>The EEBO-TCP project was divided into two phases. The 25,368 texts created during Phase 1 of the project (2000-2009), initially available only to institutions that contributed to their creation, were released into the public domain on 1 January 2015. The approximately 40,000 texts produced during Phase 2 (2009- ), of which 34,963 had been released as of 2020, originally similarly restricted, were similarly freed from all restrictions on 1 August 2020. As of that date anyone is free to take and use these texts for any purpose (modify them, annotate them, distribute them, etc.). But we do respectfully request that due credit and attribution be given to their original source.</p>
            <p>Users should be aware of the process of creating the TCP texts, and therefore of any assumptions that can be made about the data.</p>
            <p>Text selection was based on the New Cambridge Bibliography of English Literature (NCBEL). If an author (or for an anonymous work, the title) appears in NCBEL, then their works are eligible for inclusion. Selection was intended to range over a wide variety of subject areas, to reflect the true nature of the print record of the period. In general, first editions of a works in English were prioritized, although there are a number of works in other languages, notably Latin and Welsh, included and sometimes a second or later edition of a work was chosen if there was a compelling reason to do so.</p>
            <p>Image sets were sent to external keying companies for transcription and basic encoding. Quality assurance was then carried out by editorial teams in Oxford and Michigan. 5% (or 5 pages, whichever is the greater) of each text was proofread for accuracy and those which did not meet QA standards were returned to the keyers to be redone. After proofreading, the encoding was enhanced and/or corrected and characters marked as illegible were corrected where possible up to a limit of 100 instances per text. Any remaining illegibles were encoded as &lt;gap&gt;s. Understanding these processes should make clear that, while the overall quality of TCP data is very good, some errors will remain and some readable characters will be marked as illegible. Users should bear in mind that in all likelihood such instances will never have been looked at by a TCP editor.</p>
            <p>The texts were encoded and linked to page images in accordance with level 4 of the TEI in Libraries guidelines.</p>
            <p>Copies of the texts have been issued variously as SGML (TCP schema; ASCII text with mnemonic sdata character entities); displayable XML (TCP schema; characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or text strings within braces); or lossless XML (TEI P5, characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or TEI g elements).</p>

            <head>THE PREFACE</head>
            <p>WHEN I had peruſed and conſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dered the late Hiſtory of <hi>Europe,</hi> I was ſo extremely pleaſed with it, as I thought it worth my Labour to Extract all the moſt Important Tranſactions therein contained, and have Sum'd them up breifly in the following Treatiſe; And who ever will be at the pains to read it, will therein find a Relation of ſo many various Occurrences, as may afford him a pleaſing Diverſion, and a great deal of Satisfaction.</p>
            <p>But before He enter upon the Book, I would have him take notice of a few things which I thought fit to Premiſe, for his Satisfaction, and my own Vindica<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion.</p>
            <p n="1">
               <hi>1ſt.</hi> I have Varied quite from my Authors Stile, which was impoſſible for me exactly to follow, elſe my work had not been properly an Abridgement, but a Tranſcription of the Hiſtory; ſo as I was neceſſitate to pick out of each Page or Paragraph, what I found moſt Material, and dreſs it up in ſuch a homely Me<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thode and Plain Language as my own Genius could Suggeſt,</p>
            <p n="2">
               <hi>2ly.</hi> Tho I have thus fail'd in the Forme,
<pb facs="tcp:99068:5"/>I have not in the Main, for I have (with all poſſible care) kept ſo cloſs to matter of Fact, as (in my Col<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lections) I have omitted nothing needful for the Readers Information, in all notable Emergents, whereof, if any doubt, I appeal to the Original.</p>
            <p>'Tis true, there are in the Hiſtory, ſome Prolix De<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>clarations, and Intricate Debares and Altercations, at the Treaties at <hi>Nimeguen</hi> and <hi>Reſwick,</hi> with ſeveral other Excurſions from the cheif deſign of the Hiſtory, which I have deliberatly omitted; for tho I knew, the peruſal of them might be agreeable enough to the Curious and leaſurely Reader; yet the gratifying of ſuch, was not my cheif Aim, but to give the Serious and Judicious a Comprehenſive view of all Occurrences, worthy of Obſervation, or of a Room in Memory; too large a ſhare whereof, ſuch Circumſtances would have Uſurped, had they been admitted.</p>
            <p>Yet even in theſe, I have not left the Reader altogether in the Dark, for tho I have Contracted them, I have not Totally exploded them, but have given Him the Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tents, and ſuch a Curſorie view of many of them, as may lead Him, to a Competent Apprehenſion of the whole.</p>
            <p n="3">
               <hi>3ly.</hi> I Obſerve the Author goes on, in a continued Diſcourſe, only diſtinguiſhing by Paragraphs, and thoſe pretty large too, not allowing the Intent Reader any time to Breath; to eaſe him of this Fatigue, I have divided the Treatiſe into Chapters, one for each year; Again, I have Subdivided the Chapters into Sections, and have placed on the Margent the Names of the Kingdoms and Countreys, in order, as their ſeveral Affaires are therein handled, together with
<pb facs="tcp:99068:5"/>ſome other uſeful Marginal Notes: And at the end of the Book, I have placed an Index, or Table of all the moſt Remarkable Paſſages, which will readily di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rect to the Page where the ſame is Treated of.</p>
            <p>And I preſume this ſmal Peice may pretend to ſome Advantages over the Original, not only on the pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceeding account, but on ſome other Conſiderations alſo; As firſt, 'Tis of a ſmaller price, which perhaps may bear ſomewhat with the Meaner ſort, or leſs Inqui<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſitive, <hi>2ly.</hi> 'Tis of a leſſer bulk, and ſo more port<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>able and uſeful either at Home or Abroad; and any Gentleman may have it ready at hand to decide any Diſpute that my happen (in ordinary Converſation) about matters contained in it, and ſo end the Contro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>verſie.</p>
            <p n="4">
               <hi>4ly.</hi> Through the whole Series of the Hiſtory, I obſerve, the Author doth manifeſt a Paſſionate Zeal for the Prince of <hi>Orange,</hi> Our Renowned and Beloved King, Aſſigning to him, (in all Politick and State Af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fairs,) a Superlative Ripeneſs and Soundneſs of Judg<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment, and in all Warlike Exploits, the like degree of Conduct and Magnanimity.</p>
            <p>The ſame, or a greater Character (if greater needed or could be) being given Him by the Eminent Sir <hi>William Temple,</hi> in his Memoirs of his Embaſſy and Negotiation, at the Treaty of <hi>Nimeguen</hi> and elſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>where, confirmes me in the beleif of this, that the higheſt Eulogies, in his praiſe, can never reach an Hyperbole.</p>
            <p>And conſidering it my duty, not to omit any thing that may contribute to the Aggrandizing of Our Great and Famous King, or Blazoning the Grandieur and the
<pb facs="tcp:99068:6"/>Eminent Excellencies of his Ancient Family, and moſt Noble Anceſtors; I have here Tranſcribed (Verbatim) what my Author ſayes in his preface, to that purpoſe.</p>
            <p>Wherefore (ſayes He) to Conclude, as our Hiſtory ends with the General Peace we now enjoy, let our value and eſteem of Him who (under GOD) has been the Particular Inſtrument of it, our Dread Soveraign King <hi>WILLIAM,</hi> be Enhanſed more and more, who has ſo many Perſonal Excellencies, both in Peace and War, as have no manner of need to borrow from the vertue of His Anceſtors; whereof yet, there has been ſuch an Unparalel'd Chain as is not to be met with in Hiſtory; And the Antiquity of whoſe Name, for ought I can ſee, may be as old as <hi>Julius Caeſar,</hi> who in the firſt Book of His <hi>Commentaries,</hi> ſayes, a Body of <hi>Germans,</hi> out of <hi>Suabia,</hi> came, under, the Command of two Brothers, <hi>Naſua</hi> and <hi>Cimberius</hi> by Name, and ſetled upon the bank of the River of <hi>Rhine,</hi> near <hi>Treves.</hi> Now this is the more worthy of obſerva<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion, that beſides the ſimilitude of the Names of <hi>Naſua</hi> and <hi>Naſau,</hi> which only differ but in the Tranſpoſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion of one Letter, there is an Eſtate upon that ſpot of ground, which belongs to the Family, to this day. But be as it will, I was the more deſirous to take notice of it upon this occaſion, becauſe, I beleive it is the firſt time it has been done by any other, in this kind; And becauſe it may ſtir up the Curioſity of thoſe Gentlmen who are skilled in Genealogies, to make a farther Inquiry into it. So far He.</p>
            <p>I find alſo, the Learned and Famous Mr. <hi>Ruſh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>worth,</hi> in His Collections, ſays, the Family of <hi>Naſau,</hi> have been of a Princely Quality, for many ages: And
<pb facs="tcp:99068:6"/>again, ſpeaking of the Emperours Defeating the Forc<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>es of the Prince <hi>Palatine</hi> of the <hi>Rhine,</hi> near <hi>Prague,</hi> he gives this reaſon; beſides the greater number of Men, the Emperours Army (ſayes he) was Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>manded by the Greateſt and Experteſt Captains, then known in Europe, except the Prince of <hi>Orange;</hi> To be ſecond to whom, was accounted the Higheſt Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mendation.</p>
            <p>Yea, we have yet on ſtep higher to make, when ſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>veral Eminent and Emulous Princes were contending for the Weſtern Empire, amongſt all the Candidats, <hi>Adolph</hi> Earl of <hi>Naſſau,</hi> was Elected and Advanced, to the Imperial <hi>Diadem.,</hi> in <hi>Anno</hi> 1291.</p>

The Battle was fought on the 13th. of <hi>September</hi> 1697.</p>
                  <p>The only unhappineſs of the Imperialiſts was, that this Victory fell ſo late in the year, as they had not a convenient opportunity of following the blow;
<pb n="164" facs="tcp:99068:90"/>and all they could do, the ſhort remainder of the Campaign, was to make an incurſion into <hi>Boſnia,</hi> from whence they returned with a conſiderable Booty. And ſo we ſhall return to make a Conclu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſion of the Negotiations of the Peace.</p>
